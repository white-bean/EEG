## Abstract
**Background**: As mental disorders emerge as one of the most important diseases in modern society, it is essential to accurately distinguish between them. However, diagnosing mental disorders is challenging due to common clinical features, such as delusions and hallucinations, as well as the limited availability of medical data. <br>
<br>
**Objective**: We propose the deep-learning based method for classifying major psychiatric disorders based on EEG source connectivity. To enhance the prediction performance, we use the synthetic data generation via conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (cDCGAN).<br>
<br>
**Method**: We converted EEG features into a single heatmap image and used it as an input. Based on ResNet34, we constructed a binary classification model that pairwisely classifies bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and a healthy control group. Since the original dataset count differs for each disorder, with 68, 116, and 198 cases, we experimented with creating smaller sets of synthetic data, specifically 50, 100, and 200 samples and combined the synthetic data with the original data. Furthermore, we exploited Class Activation Map(CAM) to interpret which part of the image the model used to classify an image into a specific class.<br>
<br>
**Result**: The outcomes have shown that how the cDCGAN-based synthetic data generation approach has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy. For bipolar disorder, the performance was best with an addition of 50 fake samples, achieving an F1 score of 0.710 and an AUC of 0.730. For major depressive disorder, the performance peaked with the addition of 100 fake samples, achieving an F1 score of 0.800 and an AUC of 0.690. For schizophrenia, adding 100 fake samples resulted in the best performance with an F1 score of 0.880 and an AUC of 0.890.<br>
<br>
**Conclusion**: Incorporating a similar number of fake images, generated using cDCGAN, into the original dataset resulted in the most significant performance enhancement.<br>
